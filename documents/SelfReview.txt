For this assignment, we realized just how important loose coupling was in design.
One of the things we could've done earlier was plan our interfaces better. For us, this would
include creating interfaces for Event and Schedule earlier, so that the view could call on them
without needing access to one specific implementation. When getting the provider's code we realized
that their view implementation was tightly coupled with their model and didn't delegate to their
features interface at all, which in turn made it impossible for us to adapt our model to their view.
Trying to integrate their code with ours while not changing their code really helped emphasize all
the little ways we might not notice that our views relied too much on our model. Another thing we
could have done differently from the start was to not have our controller open new event frames.
Because of that, our controller would need a specific view implementation of the frame in order
to open it which made the integration of our view with theirs a little harder.
